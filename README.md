Abount some annotations: 

1)@Configuration.(Bean)
In Spring Boot configuration is a class annotation and bean is method annotation. Configuration classes declare beans through Bean-annotated methods.Bean annotation is used to indicate that a method instantiates, configures, and initializes a new object to be managed by the Spring IoC container. Configuration indicates that its primary purpose is as a source of bean definitions. 

2) @Component
Component is an annotation that allows Spring to detect our custom beans automatically and manage spring lifecycle.
Some Specific Annotations Derived from @Component-Service,Repository,Controller,RestController.

3) @Service
Service annotation is a service class declaration ,it is  used for  logicigal implementation.


4) @SpringBootApplicaiton
SpringBootApplication annotation is a combination of three annotations and serves as the main entry point for running a Spring Boot application.
@Configuration,@EnableAutoConfiguration,@ComponentScan.

5) @ResponseBody
ResponseBody annotation in Spring Boot is used for binding a return value from a resource method to a web 
response body.

6) @RequestBody
RequestBody is used to extract the HTTP request body data.Binds the request body to a method parameter.

7) @Data
Data annotation is a shortcut that combines the follwing(Getter, Setter,ToString,EqualsAndHashCode,RequiredArgsConstructor) Lombok annotations.
When we use lombok libries in data annotation class will Shorter and more readable,Automatically generated,Easier to maintain and refactor.

8) @Getter
Automatically generates getter methods for all fields.

9) @Setter
Automatically generates setter methods for all fields (except for final fields).

10)@Controller
Used for web controllers in MVC-based applications.

11) @RestController
Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody for REST APIs.
Where we first hit from Postman.

12) @RequestMapping
RequestMapping annotation is used to map requests to controllers methods.

13)@Pathvariable
PathVariable annotation is used to retrieve data from the URL path.Extracts values from the URI path.

14)@RequestParam
RequestParam annotation is used to extract query parameters from the URL in HTTP requests. It maps these parameters to method arguments in a controller.

15)@Autowird
Injects a Spring-managed bean into another component.

16)@Bean
Bean is an object that is managed by the Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) container. Typically used in a @Configuration class to define and register a bean.

17)Repository
Indicates data access layer; integrates with database exception translation.

18)Entity
Entity annotation to signify that it is a JPA entity. Java classes to database tables and their fields to table columns.

RESTfull API's:
19)Getmapping
Retrieves resources or data.

26)OneToMany	Defines a one-to-many relationship.

27)ManyToOne	Defines a many-to-one relationship.

28)ManyToMany	Defines a many-to-many relationship.

29)PrePersist	Invoked before the entity is persisted.

30)PostPersist	Invoked after the entity is persisted.

31)PreUpdate	Invoked before the entity is updated.

32)PostUpdate	Invoked after the entity is updated.

33)PreRemove	Invoked before the entity is removed.

34)PostRemove	Invoked after the entity is removed.
